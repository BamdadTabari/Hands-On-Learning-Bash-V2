# Conditional Statements (Decision Making)

# Conditions are expressions that evaluate to a boolean expression (true or false). 
# To check conditions, we can use if, if-else, if-elif-else and nested conditionals.

# if...then...fi statements | if...then...else...fi statements 
# if..elif..else..fi |   if..then..else..if..then..fi..fi.. (Nested Conditionals)
