# Comparison is used to check if statements
# evaluate to true or false. We can use the below shown operators to compare two statements:

# Operation             ==>    Syntax       ==>    Explanation
# Equality              ==>  num1 -eq num2  ==> is num1 equal to num2 ?
# Greater than equal to ==>  num1 -ge num2  ==>  is num1 greater than equal to num2 ?
